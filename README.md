# Autonomous-robot-navigation-through-waypaoints
The Turtlebot is designed to recognize ArUco Markers and extract relevant parameters from the params.yaml file. Subsequently, it will navigate to the specified positions of each component in the order specified within the yaml file.The project involves creating a ROS (Robot Operating System) package and implementing functionalities to simulate a Turtlebot navigating through an environment. The specific tasks include starting the simulation, reading ArUco markers, retrieving parameters from a YAML file, detecting parts using logical cameras, and navigating through different poses based on the specified order in the YAML file.
